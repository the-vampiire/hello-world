Hello World Practice
Hello my name is Vampiire. I started coding about one week ago (February 2017). I intend to continue coding for the rest of my life. I have been using the SoloLearn app / website to teach myself the basics of Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently I am mostly focused on the latter 3 as my friend said it will be the fastest route to getting a job.

I want to get a job as a developer so that I can learn through hands on practice in an environment surrounded by people with more experience, intelligence, and ability than myself. I hope one day I can be one of those people to a new developer.
